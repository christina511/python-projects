#Story
start = '''
It's July 20th, 2017. You are walking home from Girls Who Code when
you hear a bewildering groan coming from the Moody's entrance.
Thinking nothing of it, you continue walking to the subway entrance until
hoards of people flood out of the Path, screaming in fear. They rush past,
nearly knocking you over. Once they've cleared, you see three grotesque
human-like creatures follow behind.

You lock eyes with them and immediately run into the nearest alleyway.
There you see a lead pipe on the ground and a ladder leading up to the roof.
'''
leadpipeStory = '''
You decide to pick up the lead pipe and fight. You bash each of their heads
and make your escape. When you exit the alley, you see an entrance to the 
subway station.
'''
ladderStory = '''
Escape. Jump or fight
'''
leadpipeStoryShelter = '''
You decide to look for shelter. You turn left to see a hoard of zombies. 
You turn to your right and see even more. They have you surrounded. 
You fight as many as you can before one of them latches onto your arm.
'''
leadpipeStorySubway = '''
You decide to go down to the subway. None of the trains are running and 
there is no one in sight. You reach into your backpack and pull out a 
flashlight. You jump onto the tracks and start walking. You come to a 
fork in the road.
'''
leadpipeLeft = '''
You decide to turn left. As you venture further down, moans echo in the 
distance. You turn around and see zombies. You find that you are surrounded 
and outnumbered.
'''
leadpipeRight = '''
You decide to turn right. As you venture further down, you see a group 
of people hudled together. You approach the group and they tell you they 
are going to work together to find a cure. A man and a woman, both wearing 
bloody lab coats, rapidly explain their plan for a cure. Confused, you ask 
them where they will go and how they know what to do. The two sheepishly 
glance at each other before admitting that they accidently created the 
virus that caused the apocalypse. They ask if you want to join them.
'''
leadpipeJoin = '''
They welcome with you with open arms and you travel with them. With your 
combined knowledge, you and the group discover a cure and save humanity.
'''
leadpipeLeave = '''
They look dejected. The man walks up to you and hugs you. He says good 
luck and begins to walk away. Suddenly, he turns back around and punches
you, knocking you out instantly. You wake up to the sound of disoriented 
groans. Panicked, you reach for your backpack to see it is gone. 
The group robbed you of your supplies and left you to deal with the 
incoming hoard.
